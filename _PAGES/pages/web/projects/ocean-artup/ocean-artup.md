A site I created for my dad to promote one of his research projects: A study that aims to assess the economic viability, potential environmental risks and possible increase in oceanic CO~2~ sequestration due to artificially-induced uplift of nutrient-rich deep water to the ocean's sunlit surface layer. Funded by an ERC Advanced Grant.
