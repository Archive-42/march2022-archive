\+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Characters | Meaning | +===================================+===================================+ | `.` | Has one of the following | | | meanings: | | | | | | - Matches any single character | | | _except_ line terminators: | | | , , `\u2028` or | | | `\u2029`. For example, `/.y/` | | | matches "my" and "ay", | | | but not "yes", in "yes | | | make my day". | | | - Inside a character set, the | | | dot loses its special meaning | | | and matches a literal dot. | | | | | | Note that the `m` multiline flag | | | doesn't change the dot behavior. | | | So to match a pattern across | | | multiple lines, the character set | | | `[^]` can be used --- it will | | | match any character including | | | newlines. | | | | | | ES2018 added the `s` "dotAll" | | | flag, which allows the dot to | | | also match line terminators. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\d` | Matches any digit (Arabic | | | numeral). Equivalent to `[0-9]`. | | | For example, `/\d/` or `/[0-9]/` | | | matches "2" in "B2 is the | | | suite number". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\D` | Matches any character that is not | | | a digit (Arabic numeral). | | | Equivalent to `[^0-9]`. For | | | example, `/\D/` or `/[^0-9]/` | | | matches "B" in "B2 is the | | | suite number". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\w` | Matches any alphanumeric | | | character from the basic Latin | | | alphabet, including the | | | underscore. Equivalent to | | | `[A-Za-z0-9_]`. For example, | | | `/\w/` matches "a" in | | | "apple", "5" in "$5.28", | | | and "3" in "3D". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\W` | Matches any character that is not | | | a word character from the basic | | | Latin alphabet. Equivalent to | | | `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`. For example, | | | `/\W/` or `/[^A-Za-z0-9_]/` | | | matches "%" in "50%". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\s` | Matches a single white space | | | character, including space, tab, | | | form feed, line feed, and other | | | Unicode spaces. Equivalent to | | | `[ \f\n\r\t\v\u00a0\u1680\u2000-\ | | | u200a\u2028\u2029\u202f\u205f\u30 | | | 00\ufeff]`. | | | For example, `/\s\w*/` matches " | | | bar" in "foo bar". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\S` | Matches a single character other | | | than white space. Equivalent to | | | `[^ \f\n\r\t\v\u00a0\u1680\u2000- | | | \u200a\u2028\u2029\u202f\u205f\u3 | | | 000\ufeff]`. | | | For example, `/\S\w*/` matches | | | "foo" in "foo bar". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ |  | Matches a horizontal tab. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ |  | Matches a carriage return. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ |  | Matches a linefeed. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\v` | Matches a vertical tab. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\f` | Matches a form-feed. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `[\b]` | Matches a backspace. If you're | | | looking for the word-boundary | | | character (`\b`), see | | | Boundaries. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\0` | Matches a NUL character. Do not | | | follow this with another digit. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\cX` | Matches a control character using | | | \[caret | | | notation]\(../../../../../../../ex | | | ternal.html?link=https://en.wikip | | | edia.org/wiki/Caret\_notation){.ex | | | ternal}, | | | where "X" is a letter from A--Z | | | (corresponding to codepoints | | | `U+0001`_--_`U+001F`). For | | | example, `/\cM/` matches | | | "\r" in "\r\n". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\xhh` | Matches the character with the | | | code `hh` (two hexadecimal | | | digits). | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\uhhhh` | Matches a UTF-16 code-unit with | | | the value `hhhh` (four | | | hexadecimal digits). | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\u{hhhh} or \u{hhhhh}` | (Only when the `u` flag is set.) | | | Matches the character with the | | | Unicode value `U+hhhh` | | | or `U+hhhhh` (hexadecimal | | | digits). | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\` | Indicates that the following | | | character should be treated | | | specially, or "escaped". It | | | behaves one of two ways. | | | | | | - For characters that are | | | usually treated literally, | | | indicates that the next | | | character is special and not | | | to be interpreted literally. | | | For example, `/b/` matches | | | the character "b". By | | | placing a backslash in front | | | of "b", that is by using | | | `/\b/`, the character becomes | | | special to mean match a word | | | boundary. | | | - For characters that are | | | usually treated specially, | | | indicates that the next | | | character is not special and | | | should be interpreted | | | literally. For example, | | | "\*" is a special character | | | that means 0 or more | | | occurrences of the preceding | | | character should be matched; | | | for example, `/a*/` means | | | match 0 or more "a"s. To | | | match `*` literally, precede | | | it with a backslash; for | | | example, `/a\*/` matches | | | "a\*". | | | | | | Note that some characters like | | | `:`, `-`, `@`, etc. neither have | | | a special meaning when escaped | | | nor when unescaped. Escape | | | sequences like `\:`, `\-`, `\@` | | | will be equivalent to their | | | literal, unescaped character | | | equivalents in regular | | | expressions. However, in regular | | | expressions with the \[unicode | | | flag]\(../Regular\_Expressions.html | | | #Advanced\_searching\_with\_flags\_2) | | | , | | | these will cause an _invalid | | | identity escape_ error. This is | | | done to ensure backward | | | compatibility with existing code | | | that uses new escape sequences | | | like `\p` or `\k`. | | | | | | ::: {.blockIndicator .note} | | | To match this character | | | literally, escape it with itself. | | | In other words to search for | | | `\` use `/\\/`. | | | ::: | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

### Assertions <a href="#assertions" id="assertions"></a>

::: {.hidden} If you are looking to contribute to this document, please also edit the original article :::

#### Boundary-type assertions <a href="#boundary-type_assertions" id="boundary-type_assertions"></a>

\+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Characters | Meaning | +===================================+===================================+ | `^` | Matches the beginning of input. | | | If the multiline flag is set to | | | true, also matches immediately | | | after a line break character. For | | | example, `/^A/` does not match | | | the "A" in "an A", but does | | | match the first "A" in "An | | | A". | | | | | | ::: {.blockIndicator .note} | | | This character has a different | | | meaning when it appears at the | | | start of a | | | group. | | | ::: | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `$` | Matches the end of input. If the | | | multiline flag is set to true, | | | also matches immediately before a | | | line break character. For | | | example, `/t$/` does not match | | | the "t" in "eater", but does | | | match it in "eat". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\b` | Matches a word boundary. This is | | | the position where a word | | | character is not followed or | | | preceded by another | | | word-character, such as between a | | | letter and a space. Note that a | | | matched word boundary is not | | | included in the match. In other | | | words, the length of a matched | | | word boundary is zero. | | | | | | Examples: | | | | | | - `/\bm/` matches the "m" in | | | "moon". | | | - `/oo\b/` does not match the | | | "oo" in "moon", because | | | "oo" is followed by "n" | | | which is a word character. | | | - `/oon\b/` matches the "oon" | | | in "moon", because "oon" | | | is the end of the string, | | | thus not followed by a word | | | character. | | | - `/\w\b\w/` will never match | | | anything, because a word | | | character can never be | | | followed by both a non-word | | | and a word character. | | | | | | To match a backspace character | | | (`[\b]`), see Character | | | Classes. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `\B` | Matches a non-word boundary. This | | | is a position where the previous | | | and next character are of the | | | same type: Either both must be | | | words, or both must be non-words, | | | for example between two letters | | | or between two spaces. The | | | beginning and end of a string are | | | considered non-words. Same as the | | | matched word boundary, the | | | matched non-word boundary is also | | | not included in the match. For | | | example, `/\Bon/` matches "on" | | | in "at noon", and `/ye\B/` | | | matches "ye" in "possibly | | | yesterday". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

#### Other assertions <a href="#other_assertions" id="other_assertions"></a>

::: {.blockIndicator .note} **Note**: The `?` character may also be used as a quantifier. :::

\+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Characters | Meaning | +===================================+===================================+ | `x(?=y)` | \*\*Lookahead assertion: \*\*Matches | | | "x" only if "x" is followed | | | by "y". For example, | | | /`Jack(?=Sprat)/` matches | | | "Jack" only if it is followed | | | by "Sprat".\ | | | `/Jack(?=Sprat|Frost)/` matches | | | "Jack" only if it is followed | | | by "Sprat" or "Frost". | | | However, neither "Sprat" nor | | | "Frost" is part of the match | | | results. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `x(?!y)` | \*\*Negative lookahead | | | assertion: \*\*Matches "x" only | | | if "x" is not followed by | | | "y". For example, `/\d+(?!\.)/` | | | matches a number only if it is | | | not followed by a decimal | | | point. `/\d+(?!\.)/.exec('3.141') | | |` | | | matches "141" but not "3". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `(?<=y)x` | \*\*Lookbehind assertion: \*\*Matches | | | "x" only if "x" is | | | preceded by "y". For example, | | | `/(?<=Jack)Sprat/` matches | | | "Sprat" only if it is preceded | | | by | | | "Jack". `/(?<=Jack|Tom)Sprat/` | | | matches "Sprat" only if it is | | | preceded by "Jack" or "Tom". | | | However, neither "Jack" nor | | | "Tom" is part of the match | | | results. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `(?<!y)x` | \*\*Negative lookbehind | | | assertion: \*\*Matches "x" only | | | if "x" is not preceded by | | | "y". For example, `/(?<!-)\d+/` | | | matches a number only if it is | | | not preceded by a minus | | | sign. `/(?<!-)\d+/.exec('3')` | | | matches | | | "3". `/(?<!-)\d+/.exec('-3')` | | |  match is not found because | | | the number is preceded by the | | | minus sign. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

### Groups and ranges <a href="#groups_and_ranges" id="groups_and_ranges"></a>

::: {.hidden} If you are looking to contribute to this document, please also edit the original article :::

\+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Characters | Meaning | +===================================+===================================+ | `x|y` | Matches either "x" or "y". | | | For example, `/green|red/` | | | matches "green" in "green | | | apple" and "red" in "red | | | apple". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `[xyz] [a-c]` | A character set. Matches any one | | | of the enclosed characters. You | | | can specify a range of characters | | | by using a hyphen, but if the | | | hyphen appears as the first or | | | last character enclosed in the | | | square brackets it is taken as a | | | literal hyphen to be included in | | | the character set as a normal | | | character. It is also possible to | | | include a character class in a | | | character set. | | | | | | For example, `[abcd]` is the same | | | as `[a-d]`. They match the "b" | | | in "brisket", and the "c" in | | | "chop". | | | | | | For example, `[abcd-]` and | | | `[-abcd]` match the "b" in | | | "brisket", the "c" in | | | "chop", and the "-" (hyphen) | | | in "non-profit". | | | | | | For example, `[\w-]` is the same | | | as `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`. They both | | | match the "b" in "brisket", | | | the "c" in "chop", and the | | | "n" in "non-profit". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `[^xyz] [^a-c]` | A negated or complemented | | | character set. That is, it | | | matches anything that is not | | | enclosed in the brackets. You can | | | specify a range of characters by | | | using a hyphen, but if the hyphen | | | appears as the first or last | | | character enclosed in the square | | | brackets it is taken as a literal | | | hyphen to be included in the | | | character set as a normal | | | character. For example, `[^abc]` | | | is the same as `[^a-c]`. They | | | initially match "o" in | | | "bacon" and "h" in "chop". | | | | | | ::: {.blockIndicator .note} | | | The ^ character may also | | | indicate the beginning of | | | input. | | | ::: | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `(x)` | \*\*Capturing group: \*\*Matches `x` | | | and remembers the match. For | | | example, `/(foo)/` matches and | | | remembers "foo" in "foo | | | bar".  | | | | | | A regular expression may have | | | multiple capturing groups. In | | | results, matches to capturing | | | groups typically in an array | | | whose members are in the same | | | order as the left parentheses in | | | the capturing group. This is | | | usually just the order of the | | | capturing groups themselves. This | | | becomes important when capturing | | | groups are nested. Matches are | | | accessed using the index of the | | | the result's elements | | | (`[1], ..., [n]`) or from the | | | predefined `RegExp` object's | | | properties (`$1, ..., $9`). | | | | | | Capturing groups have a | | | performance penalty. If you | | | don't need the matched substring | | | to be recalled, prefer | | | non-capturing parentheses (see | | | below). | | | | | | `String.match()` won't return | | | groups if the `/.../g` flag is | | | set. However, you can still use | | | `String.matchAll()` to get all | | | matches. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ |  | Where "n" is a positive | | | integer. A back reference to the | | | last substring matching the n | | | parenthetical in the regular | | | expression (counting left | | | parentheses). For example, | | | `/apple(,)\sorange\1/` matches | | | "apple, orange," in "apple, | | | orange, cherry, peach". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | \k\<Name> | A back reference to the last | | | substring matching the \*\*Named | | | capture group \*\*specified | | | by `<Name>`. | | | | | | For | | | example, `/(?<title>\w+), yes \k< | | | title>/` matches | | | "Sir, yes Sir" in "Do you | | | copy? Sir, yes Sir!". | | | | | | ::: {.blockIndicator .note} | | | `\k` is used literally here to | | | indicate the beginning of a back | | | reference to a Named capture | | | group. | | | ::: | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `(?<Name>x)` | \*\*Named capturing | | | group: \*\*Matches "x" and stores | | | it on the groups property of the | | | returned matches under the name | | | specified by `<Name>`. The angle | | | brackets (`<` and `>`) are | | | required for group name. | | | | | | For example, to extract the | | | United States area code from a | | | phone number, we could use | | | `/\((?<area>\d\d\d)\)/`. The | | | resulting number would appear | | | under `matches.groups.area`. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `(?:x)` | \*\*Non-capturing group: \*\*Matches | | | "x" but does not remember the | | | match. The matched substring | | | cannot be recalled from the | | | resulting array's elements | | | (`[1], ..., [n]`) or from the | | | predefined `RegExp` object's | | | properties (`$1, ..., $9`). | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

### Quantifiers <a href="#quantifiers" id="quantifiers"></a>

::: {.hidden} If you are looking to contribute to this document, please also edit the original article :::

::: {.blockIndicator .note} **Note:** In the following, _item_ refers not only to singular characters, but also includes character classes, Unicode property escapes, groups and ranges. :::

\+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | Characters | Meaning | +===================================+===================================+ | `x*` | Matches the preceding item "x" | | | 0 or more times. For example, | | | `/bo*/` matches "boooo" in "A | | | ghost booooed" and "b" in "A | | | bird warbled", but nothing in | | | "A goat grunted". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `x+` | Matches the preceding item "x" | | | 1 or more times. Equivalent to | | | `{1,}`. For example, `/a+/` | | | matches the "a" in "candy" | | | and all the "a"'s in | | | "caaaaaaandy". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `x?` | Matches the preceding item "x" | | | 0 or 1 times. For example, | | | `/e?le?/` matches the "el" in | | | "angel" and the "le" in | | | "angle." | | | | | | If used immediately after any of | | | the quantifiers `*`, `+`, `?`, or | | | `{}`, makes the quantifier | | | non-greedy (matching the minimum | | | number of times), as opposed to | | | the default, which is greedy | | | (matching the maximum number of | | | times). | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `x{n}` | Where "n" is a positive | | | integer, matches exactly "n" | | | occurrences of the preceding item | | | "x". For example, `/a{2}/` | | | doesn't match the "a" in | | | "candy", but it matches all of | | | the "a"'s in "caandy", and | | | the first two "a"'s in | | | "caaandy". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `x{n,}` | Where "n" is a positive | | | integer, matches at least "n" | | | occurrences of the preceding item | | | "x". For example, `/a{2,}/` | | | doesn't match the "a" in | | | "candy", but matches all of the | | | a's in "caandy" and in | | | "caaaaaaandy". | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `x{n,m}` | Where "n" is 0 or a positive | | | integer, "m" is a positive | | | integer, and `m > n`, matches at | | | least "n" and at most "m" | | | occurrences of the preceding item | | | "x". For example, `/a{1,3}/` | | | matches nothing in "cndy", the | | | "a" in "candy", the two | | | "a"'s in "caandy", and the | | | first three "a"'s in | | | "caaaaaaandy". Notice that when | | | matching "caaaaaaandy", the | | | match is "aaa", even though the | | | original string had more "a"s | | | in it. | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+ | `x*?`\ | By default quantifiers like `*` | | `x+?`\ | and `+` are "greedy", meaning | | `x??`\ | that they try to match as much of | | `x{n}?`\ | the string as possible. The `?` | | `x{n,}?`\ | character after the quantifier | | `x{n,m}?` | makes the quantifier | | | "non-greedy": meaning that it | | | will stop as soon as it finds a | | | match. For example, given a | | | string like "some \<foo> | | | \<bar> new \</bar> \</foo> | | | thing": | | | | | | - `/<.*>/` will match "\<foo> | | | \<bar> new \</bar> | | | \</foo>" | | | - `/<.*?>/` will match | | | "\<foo>" | +-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

// Binary and non-binary values
\p{UnicodeBinaryPropertyName}

// Negation: \P is negated \p
\P{UnicodePropertyValue}
\P{UnicodeBinaryPropertyName}
```

UnicodeBinaryPropertyName

The name of a binary property{.external}. E.g.: `ASCII`, `Alpha`, `Math`, `Diacritic`, `Emoji`, `Hex_Digit`, `Math`, `White_space`, etc. See Unicode Data PropList.txt{.external} for more info.

UnicodePropertyName

The name of a non-binary{.external} property:

* General\_Category{.external} (`gc`)
* Script{.external} (`sc`)
* Script\_Extensions{.external} (`scx`)

See also PropertyValueAliases.txt{.external}

UnicodePropertyValue : One of the tokens listed in the Values section, below. Many values have aliases or shorthand (e.g. the value `Decimal_Number` for the `General_Category` property may be written `Nd`, `digit`, or `Decimal_Number`). For most values, the _`UnicodePropertyName`_ part and equals sign may be omitted. If a \*`UnicodePropertyName` \*is specified, the value must correspond to the property type given.
