## React Clock

Using React, build a digital clock that displays the current (west coast) time (non-military).

To get started, download the [react-setup.zip](./react-setup.zip?raw=true). Don't forget to ```npm install``` and ```npm run```.

### Clarifying points

1. You can only get current time once.
2. You must display hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM.
3. Try not to use external resources, but if you must, you can only use MDN and React docs.
4. Style it as best as you can within the allotted time.
5. You have 60 minutes to complete this (please set a timer).
6. Bonus: Add an alarm

### Hints

1. dateObj.getHours() returns the hour from 0 to 23.
2. Numbers should be padded with zeroes (ie. 02:45:06, not 2:45:6)

A solution will be posted this evening.
